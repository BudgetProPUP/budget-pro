- Are proposals already approved and allocated? Because the Total Budget card might change
- monthly budget vs actual: The implemented approach for the Monthly Budget vs Actual API distributes the total project or department budget evenly
    across months within the fiscal year or specific project duration, enabling a clear comparison between planned and actual spending. 
    This method was chosen for its simplicity, alignment with available data (annual allocations), and flexibility, supporting both department-wide and project-specific visualizations. 
    It assumes uniform monthly distribution in the absence of fine-grained monthly planning, which is acceptable for initial reporting. 
    However, if future business processes introduce detailed monthly allocations or varying disbursement schedules, 
    this logic must be updated to reflect actual monthly planning or cash flow-based allocation strategies.
